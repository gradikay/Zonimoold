Welcome to the Zonimo wiki!

# Overview
Zonimo was a project which I started working on in late 2015 and I build it entirely.
After I completed learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, I started building simple websites.
Then, an idea was born from my love of animals and programming. I wanted to create a platform that was all about them (animals). Zonimo was born.

It was first called AnimalGenuis.com, and later became Zonimo.

It was built entirely from PHP and a little CSS, HTML, and JavaScript using CodeIgniter.
